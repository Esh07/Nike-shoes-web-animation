# Web Animation Learning Journey
This repository is a collection of my learning and experimentation with web animation techniques using CSS transitions and transformations. I am still on a learning curve, and this project serves as a snapshot of my current understanding of web animation. This repository will continue to be updated as I learn and explore more about web animation.

## Technology
- HTML
- CSS

## What I learned
- CSS transitions for hover effects
- CSS transformations for moving and rotating elements
- CSS layout and positioning properties
- CSS [specificity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0kfcP_nD9E) for correct style application : pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, IDs and class selectors etc. with the specificity in mind.
